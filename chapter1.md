1. Python is an interpreted language
2. Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.
3. Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably
   - the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
   - statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
   - no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
